				<h2>About Rob Birch</h2>
					<p >
					<img src='./images/download.png'>Rob got into programming when he discovered how much he liked it and how much value it adds to people's lives. His first real foray into creating a program that created a lot of value was when he wrote a program that helped reduced the amount of escrow analyses in a mortgage portfolio. Customers were happy that their payments were more stable throughout the year and
					as a consquence his company was ranked as one of the best mortgage servicer of the year. His focus is on JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, Chai, and Jest.
				   </p>
				   <p>
				   	When Rob isn't programming he is reading books on finance, economics and programming, running and cooking good food with his wife in the Bay Area. Occasionally , he'll tell one liners like, "There are ten types of people in this world. Those that know binary, and those that don't". He isn't sure which one he is though...
